# AIRBNB-ANALYSIS-
This project analyzes NYC Airbnb listings using uncleaned data in Power BI. The dashboard reveals pricing, availability, cancellation policies, and review trends, highlighting borough-level and temporal patterns. It demonstrates how visualization uncovers insights even from raw data.
Airbnb NYC Data Analysis Dashboard

**Problem Statement**

The Airbnb market in New York City exhibits significant variation in pricing, availability, and host policies across different boroughs. However, the dataset used for this project was uncleaned and contained inconsistencies, missing values, and possible outliers. These factors make it difficult to derive accurate insights without preprocessing.
The goal of this project is to analyze the raw dataset and develop a Power BI dashboard that visualizes the key patterns in Airbnb listings across New York City. The focus is on understanding borough-level pricing trends, cancellation flexibility, property availability, and customer review patterns, even when working with unrefined data.

**Objectives**

To visualize borough-wise trends in Airbnb pricing and listing distribution.

To compare cancellation policies across booking types.

To analyze listing availability geographically across New York City.

To observe customer review activity over the years and identify notable patterns.

To demonstrate how insights can still be extracted from uncleaned data through effective visualization.

**Dashboard Findings**
1. Price Trends Across NYC Boroughs

The average price across all boroughs is approximately $623.55, with prices ranging from $50 to $1,200.
Among boroughs, Staten Island shows the highest average price, followed by the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. The results indicate an unexpected pattern where Manhattan, typically the most expensive borough, shows a lower average price, likely due to incomplete or inconsistent data entries in the uncleaned dataset.

2. Price Distribution and Variability

The large difference between the minimum and maximum prices suggests high variability across listings. This may reflect differences in property types, amenities, or data inconsistencies. Further data cleaning would be necessary to establish a more accurate pricing trend.

3. Booking Type vs. Cancellation Flexibility

The distribution of cancellation policies among listings is nearly even, with:

Flexible: 35.15%

Moderate: 32.58%

Strict: 32.27%

This balanced distribution indicates that hosts offer a diverse range of booking flexibility options, accommodating different guest preferences and levels of commitment.

4. Listing Availability Across NYC Map

Geospatial visualization shows that listings are highly concentrated in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, with relatively fewer in Staten Island and the Bronx. This aligns with NYC’s tourism and population density, where most visitors prefer staying closer to central urban areas with better access to attractions and public transportation.

5. Total Reviews Over the Years

The time-series analysis of total reviews reveals that 2019 had the highest number of reviews, indicating peak activity before the pandemic period. Subsequent years show a sharp decline in reviews, consistent with the impact of travel restrictions and reduced tourism activity. This finding provides insight into the temporal dynamics of Airbnb engagement in NYC.

**Key Observations**

The dataset, being uncleaned, produced some anomalies such as the lower average price in Manhattan.

Despite inconsistencies, clear market patterns emerge that highlight borough-level differences in pricing and host behavior.

The balanced distribution of cancellation policies suggests a mature and diversified market catering to multiple guest preferences.

2019 was a standout year for Airbnb activity in New York City, followed by a notable downturn during the subsequent years.

Future work should involve cleaning the dataset to remove null values, duplicates, and outliers for improved reliability of insights.

**Tools and Technologies Used**

Microsoft Power BI for data visualization and dashboard development.

Uncleaned Airbnb Dataset (NYC) for raw data analysis.


The analysis demonstrates that meaningful insights can be drawn even from uncleaned datasets through proper visualization techniques. The Airbnb NYC Dashboard successfully identifies key pricing, booking, and review trends across boroughs. It highlights the impact of data quality on analytical outcomes and provides a foundation for more refined analyses after dataset cleaning and transformation.
